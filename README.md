Music genre classification was created using python and other libraries used are mentioned in `requirements.py`.
The Main concept used for the classification of different songs (sample input song in this case) is <a href ="https://www.javatpoint.com/k-nearest-neighbor-algorithm-for-machine-learning">KNN Algorithm</a> which is used to determine the closeness from the already well labeled and defined dataset provided by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?resource=download">GTZAN</a>. 

There are two files,
<br>
`music_genre.py` which firstly tests our classification accuracy and, <br>
`test.py` which classifies input file.
